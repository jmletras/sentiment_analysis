Online Reputation Sensor: machine learning techniques for detection and classification of opinions in Web textual sources

The purpose of this work is to present a system with the ability to predict, through machine
learning techniques, the sense of a sentence and the respective reputation impact on the
target entity, classifying it as negative, positive or neutral. This system was developed in
Python and uses resources from NLTK framework, such as entity recognition (NE Chunk),
the grammar classifier (pos tag) and the algorithms used in system development (Naive
Bayes, Decision Trees, and SVM).
